STL Containers 
Sequence Containers : implement data structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner
    ->  vector
    ->  list    
    ->  deque
    ->  arrays
    ->  forward_list

Container Adaptors : provide a different interface for sequential containers
    ->  queue
    ->  priority_queue
    ->  stack

Associative Containers : implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity)
    ->  set
    ->  multiset
    ->  map
    ->  mutlimap

Unordered Associative Containers : implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched
    ->  unordered_set
    ->  unordered_multiset
    ->  unordered_map
    ->  unordered_mutlimap
