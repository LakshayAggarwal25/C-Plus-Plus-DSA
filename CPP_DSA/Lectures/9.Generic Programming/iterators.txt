Iterators 
Iterators as an entity that help us to access the data within a container with certain restrictions

Input Iterators:
    A entity through which you can read data from container and move ahead. Eg Keyboard

Output Iterators:
    A entity through which you can write into the container and move ahead. 

Forward Iterators:
    Iterator with funtionalities of input and output interator in single direction. Eg Singly Linked list

Bidirectional Iterator:
    Forward interator that can move in both directions.

Random Access Iterators:
    Random Access Iterator is an iterator that can read/ write in both directions and also can take jumps.

Why Iterators ? 
->  To make generic algorithms with freedom from underlying data structures.
    For Example:
    We can make a function to work on all data types using Templates.
    Now we can make functions to work on all types of Containers using Iterators
