Some Special Functions that C++ Classes give when you create a class/object
4 different special functions that are always present inside a class

1.  Constructor
        - that is responsible for creating an object
        - gets called automatically and only once
        - same name as class name
        - Parametrized Constructor

2.  Copy Constructor
        - make a copy of the given object
        - exists by default
        - need to create our own copy Constructor to create a deep copy, this is only required when working with/using pointers 
          inside class

3.  Copy Assignment Operator
        - denote by =
        - copies when you do Assignment
        - Car d = c; // This is a Copy Constructor
        - Car d;
        - d = c; // This is copy Assignment Operator
        - here also to by default it creates a shallow copy, we can create deep copies by overriding the default Assignment Operator
        - can be called as many times

4.  Destructor
        - Clear out the memory occupied by the object
        - gets called automatically when the object goes out of scope
        - need to override the Destructor when using pointers as data members 
        - object that is created later will be the first one to get destroyed
